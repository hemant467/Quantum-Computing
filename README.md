### A Structured Computational Study of Foundational Quantum Computing Principles

---

## Abstract

This repository presents a structured computational exploration of fundamental concepts in Quantum Computing.  
The project focuses on translating theoretical quantum mechanical principles into executable simulations using Python-based scientific tools. Emphasis is placed on mathematical rigor, state representation, and circuit-level modeling to develop a strong foundational understanding suitable for academic and research contexts.

## 1. Introduction

Quantum Computing represents a paradigm shift from classical computation by leveraging superposition, entanglement, and probabilistic measurement.  

This project aims to:

- Model qubit systems using linear algebra
- Implement quantum gates through matrix representations
- Simulate multi-qubit interactions
- Analyze measurement probabilities
- Bridge theoretical constructs with computational execution

The notebook serves as an academic reference for structured experimentation.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

The implementation is grounded in:

- Complex vector spaces  
- Dirac notation and state vectors  
- Unitary matrix transformations  
- Tensor products for multi-qubit systems  
- Probabilistic measurement postulates  

All transformations preserve normalization constraints consistent with quantum mechanical principles.
